# Welcome to Foogle! (Fake Google)

Foogle does (almost) everything that Google can do right inside your python terminal. 

Foogle allows you to:

- Browse the Web

- Read at wikipedia pages

- Look up terms on Urban Dictionary

- and more! (CNN / Brittanica coming soon)

You can use Foogle from your browser by running the program here:
